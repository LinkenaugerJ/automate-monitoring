# **automate-monitoring**

### Currently, I have about 10 separate email alerts set up for product monitoring.  Ideally, it would be great to not have to open each of these every morning.  If I could have them be opened upon running a rake task and then scan through the pages in order to find certain criteria then this would allow items that need attention to be brough to the forefront.
